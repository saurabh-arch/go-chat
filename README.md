# go-chat
chat application using go


# Supported Platform
1. Linux/Ubuntu


# TODO's
- [x] add time stamp to msgs 
- [ ] To do debian packaging for client side installation
- [ ] adding middleware or route parsing on the server to allow multiple different chats based on endpoint or URL params
- [ ] enabling TLS on client and server, 
- [ ] fleshing out the error handling (you’ll want clients to be able to exit the pool gracefully and may want to let other clients know they’re gone) 
- [ ] enable edit message after its being sent
