# go-chat
chat application using go


# TODO's
1. - [ ] enabling TLS on client and server, 
2. - [ ] fleshing out the error handling (you’ll want clients to be able to exit the pool gracefully and may want to let other clients know they’re gone) 
3. - [ ] adding middleware or route parsing on the server to allow multiple different chats based on endpoint or URL params
